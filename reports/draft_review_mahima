# Draft Review

Your draft review should include the following elements:

Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
