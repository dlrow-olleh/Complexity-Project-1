# Modelling Traffic with Cellular Automata

###### by Mahima Beltur and Jason Sol

## Abstract

An accurate simulation of traffic is very useful tool that serves endless purposes. Due to their nature, specifically their simplicity and versatility, celular automata are ideal candidates to use in modelling unrealistic vehicular behaviour. However, microscopic traffic models (usually designed as a series of differential equations) are more accurate in modeling regulated traffic flow, but are computationally much more expensive. The report we are following for this project takes a combined approach. They introduced the idea of using a stochastic cellular automata traffic model in which space is continuous, and also se a fuzzy system to handle uncertainites in decision making. This enables the simulation of different driver behaviours. For this project, we will first mimic Rodaro and Yeldan's model using the same stochastic and fuzzy models, and then attempt to see how well this model holds when various constraints are involved in driving such as road barricades.
